    text: "I went through THREE companies before landing on Dallas Window Butler. First one ghosted me. Second one tried to upsell me on stuff I didn't need. Third one gave me a 'discount' that still wasn't competitive. These guys? Gave me a real price, did solid work, and left my house cleaner than when they got there.",

    text: "The windows were scheduled to be installed in two days. There was due to weather they sent a big crew and installed in just one day. We have had windows installed in the past and these installers are the best. They took care of all the window treatments and trim work was great. The house was cleaner after they left.",

    text: "Windows came in, they scheduled the install for the next day. They arrived at my place 5 minutes early! They took over and I just sat and watched. They were great at communicating what they were doing and right in choosing them. They cleaned up after themselves and it was like they were never there except for the beautiful new windows. I made the right choice and am a happy camper. My best customer service!",
